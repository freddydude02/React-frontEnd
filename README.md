# Student-Resourcing Front-End

**Description of project:** </br>
A react app that is made for the spring student resourcing API at the link below. This project was also used to learn my first deployment using AWS s3 <a>
https://github.com/freddydude02/Student-Resourcing-API
</a>  
</br>
**Setup:** </br>
-clone repo and run

note: note the frontend buttons will not be operational as it is only the front-end component to the backend Spring app that needs to be deployed as well to use it's functions

**Approach / Design Goals:** </br>
The approach was to create a small app that can utilise Spring student resoucing API while deployed on s3 which means
- minimal styling
- basic and functional API requests (getting around cors)
- deployable on AWS s3

**Things I'd differently next time:** </br>
  - implement a safer and more scalable configuration of CORS in the Spring App
   
**Future goals / changes:** </br>
  - Improve on scss and theming of app instead of basic blue
  - add more features such as tables that are filled out based on given info

**Challenges:** </br>
- Navigating cors for the first time
