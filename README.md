# Student-Resourcing Front-End-App

**Description of project:** </br>
This project was also used to learn my first deployment using AWS s3. It is also the front-end component to a backend Spring Boot app linked below.</br>

</br>
**Setup:** </br>
- clone repo
- navigate to inner most folder "frontend-app"
- open in VS Code
- "npm start" in console

Note:</br>
The buttons will not be operational. To use it, navigate to the Student-Resourcing-API linked at the top and set it up before proceeding. </br>

**Approach / Design Goals:** </br>
The approach was to create a small app that can utilise Spring student resoucing API while deployed on s3 which means
- minimal styling
- basic and functional API requests (getting around cors)
- deployable on AWS s3

**Things I'd differently next time:** </br>
  - implement a safer and more scalable configuration of CORS in the Spring App
   
**Future goals / changes:** </br>
  - Improve on scss and theming of app instead of basic blue
  - add more features such as tables that are filled out based on given info

**Challenges:** </br>
- Navigating cors for the first time
